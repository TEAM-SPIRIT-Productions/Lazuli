Lazuli is a Python library for interacting with Odin-like MapleStory private
server databases. Lazuli contains wrappers around MySQL Connector, and is
meant to complement the Azure v316 MapleStory private server emulator source
code.

### Word of Caution  
Please note that database changes will not take effect if the server is running. 
Please make sure to only use the setter/adders when the server is not running 
or, better yet, avoid these mutators altogether.
